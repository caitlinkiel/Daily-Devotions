        <h3 class="calligraphy">Devotional</h3>
        <p class="serif"><b>Reflection</b><br/>One of the things that sustained servants of God like Daniel during the time of exile was their belief in God's dream for a new world of justice and peace that would be ushered in by God's Messiah. These ancient elievers often looked back to the Exodus to remember how God had liberated God's people from slavery. These memories gave them hope and boldness to expect that God would do it again. Even though their country was desolate, and their Temple was in ruins, the people believed that God could restore them again and they prayed for this salvation to come.</p>
<p>In the time before Christ's birth, God's people were in a similar place. Once again, they had been conquered, and they longed for liberation, and so again they turned to the Exodus story for hope.</p>
<p>The prayer of Daniel takes note of the harsh realities of the world, but looks back to God's past work of salvation, and then looks forward to God's future saving work. As we begin our preparation for Advent, we do a similar thing. We take note of the struggles facing our world, and the huge gap between our current reality and the dream of God's reign. Then, we remember how God has rescued God's people in the past, while looking forward to the time when God's reign will be fully revealed among us. If there is anything that can renew our faith and hope in the reign of Christ it is Advent.</p>
<p>Today renew your commitment to remember God's saving work and to worship with faith and hope through Advent.</p>
<p><b>Response</b><br/>Notice how much of Daniel's prayer is focused not on who God's people are, but on who God is. Daniel's hope lies in God's undeserved love and grace, and not on anything the people can do to earn God's favour. When we seek to nurture our hope and faith, the best starting point is to focus on who God is, and then to dedicate ourselves to following God for God's own sake. Today, offer yourself to God again, because of God's grace and goodness.</p>

      <!-- Closing (Scripture) prayer -->
      <div class="stack-block" style="margin-top:12px">
        <h3 class="calligraphy">Closing Prayer</h3>
        <p class="serif">No matter what I may have to deal with in the world, O God, I dedicate myself to you because of your goodness and grace.</p>
<p>Unexpected God,
<br/>your advent alarms us.
<br/>Wake us from drowsy worship,
<br/>from the sleep that neglects love,
<br/>and the sedative of misdirected frenzy.
<br/>Awaken us now to your coming,
<br/>and bend our angers into your peace. Amen.</p>

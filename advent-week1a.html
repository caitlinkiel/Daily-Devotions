        <h3 class="calligraphy">Devotional</h3>
        <p class="serif"><b>Reflection</b><br/>One of the things that sustained servants of God like Daniel during the time of exile was their belief in God's dream for a new world of justice and peace that would be ushered in by God's Messiah. These ancient elievers often looked back to the Exodus to remember how God had liberated God's people from slavery. These memories gave them hope and boldness to expect that God would do it again. Even though their country was desolate, and their Temple was in ruins, the people believed that God could restore them again and they prayed for this salvation to come.</p>
           <p>In the time before Christ's birth, God's people were in a similar place. Once again, they had been conquered, and they longed for liberation, and so again they turned to the Exodus story for hope.</p>
           <p>The prayer of Daniel takes note of the harsh realities of the world, but looks back to God's past work of salvation, and then looks forward to God's future saving work. As we begin our preparation for Advent, we do a similar thing. We take note of the struggles facing our world, and the huge gap between our current reality and the dream of God's reign. Then, we remember how God has rescued God's people in the past, while looking forward to the time when God's reign will be fully revealed among us. If there is anything that can renew our faith and hope in the reign of Christ it is Advent.</p>
           <p>Today renew your commitment to remember God's saving work and to worship with faith and hope through Advent.</p>
           <p><b>Response</b><br/>Notice how much of Daniel's prayer is focused not on who God's people are, but on who God is. Daniel's hope lies in God's undeserved love and grace, and not on anything the people can do to earn God's favour. When we seek to nurture our hope and faith, the best starting point is to focus on who God is, and then to dedicate ourselves to following God for God's own sake. Today, offer yourself to God again, because of God's grace and goodness.</p>

        <p class="serif"><b>Reflection</b><br/>When Jesus told his disciples about the coming time of turmoil, and of his own glorification, he referred to the time of Noah, when people were completely unprepared for calamity. Today, we read the preamble to the flood story.
         <br/>It is important to keep in mind that the writers of this account did not have the benefit of Jesus' revelation of God's grace and mercy. Yet, they still show God as a grieving parent who reluctantly judges humanity, while saving a remnant to continue to work through. For us, there are two lessons in this story. Firstly, God is concerned for what happens among God's creatures, and God works in and through the world to bring justice into being. Secondly, God's grace and love is that of a grieving parent seeking to liberate and heal all people. Advent reminds us that God is involved in our lives, and that God is working to bring healing and justice into our world. But, just as the flood surprised the people of Noah’s time, so the coming of God's grace and presence is often surprising and unexpected. That's why we need always to be alert and ready.
         <br/>How can you prepare your heart for God's coming today?</p> 
        <p><b>Response</b><br/>To be alert for God's coming – or rather the manifestation of God's presence that is always with us – we need to practice mindfulness. This means practicing the discipline of opening our hearts and awareness to God's presence and activity in our lives. One of the best ways to learn this awareness is through stillness. As we allow ourselves to become still, we turn our awareness to God's Spirit, and we learn how to recognise God's presence and hear God's voice. Make some time for stillness today.</p>

        <h3 class="calligraphy">Devotional</h3>
        <p class="serif"><b>Reflection</b><br/>A couple of weeks ago we focussed on Luke's version of today's reading. Back then we were exploring the way God's reign remains true and sure even in the face of great turmoil, and how our ordinary actions help to express the values of God's reign in our world. Today, we prepare ourselves for Advent Sunday, and the reminder that God is always coming to us with the promise of grace, mercy, and peace. The struggle with interpreting today's reading is that it combines two perspectives that must be held together. On the one hand there is the teaching about the Temple's destruction and the time of turbulence in which this will happen. As the Gospel writer was penning these words, the Temple had already been destroyed, and followers of Christ were being persecuted for their faith. On the other hand, there is the apocalyptic language (that is, language which reveals deep truths) from Daniel, which is often taken to refer to Jesus' final return in glory. But Jesus knew that the Roman invasion and persecution would happen, and so he warned his followers to stay faithful and to trust in God's reign in the midst of the struggle. But he also assured them of God's presence and God's Spirit to strengthen and guide them through these difficult times.
         <br/>The message of the Advent season, which we begin tomorrow, is that God is always breaking into our experience now (not just in the past and future) to enable us to live faithfully according to the mission of Jesus, even when the world is in turmoil, as it is now. 
         <br/>How can you open yourself to the comforting, strengthening presence of God?</p> 
        <p><b>Response</b><br/>The practice of prayer is sometimes thought of as an attempt to get God to do what we want. But it is more accurate to think of prayer as an attempt to see what God is already doing, and then to align ourselves with that. Today, as you pray, ask God to reveal God's presence and activity to you, and seek to live in accordance with God's direction.</p>

        <h3 class="calligraphy">Gospel Meditation</h3>
        <p class="serif"><b>Reflection</b><br/>In context, this passage flows out of Jesus' prediction of the destruction of the Temple, and his call for his followers to stay alert and watch for the signs of God's Reign in the midst of the turmoil. By the time this account was written, Jerusalem had been sacked for some time, along with the destruction of the Temple, and the believers were under threat of persecution. These are the events that Jesus is referring to in verse 36, and they had come as just such a shocking surprise to many. The descriptions of people being swept away, of one person being taken while another one is left, is not a reference to an end time rapture, but to events that had already been experienced by the first believers.
          <br/>Yet, in the midst of these turbulent times, Jesus promised, he would come to his people. While the New Testament does point to a future time in history when Christ's return will be completed, the sense of Jesus words is that we should always be alert and watching for the signs of God's presence breaking into our lives. Our hope then is that we would know God's presence and sustaining strength now in the face of this age’s great challenges, and that, one day, the world will be healed and made completely new and whole. Both of these hopes are necessary if we are to follow Jesus faithfully, and witness to God's presence and activity in our world.
          <br/>How can you watch and be alert for Christ's coming to you today?</p>

        <p class="serif"><b>Reflection</b><br/>The first Sunday in Advent is generally considered to be a time when we consider the Return of Christ. While the Scriptures definitely do call us to consider Christ's return, and to place our hope in his coming, how we answer this call can make a huge difference to how we live our lives. If we make the return of Christ the "real thing" after the "curtain raiser" of life here and now, we inevitably devalue this world and the lives we live in it. If we become obsessed with predicting the time and manner of Christ's coming, we lose touch with the world we are called to serve now. And if we make too much of the future return of Christ, we may end up missing God's coming to us in the midst of our daily routines now.
          <br/>If we are to avoid these pitfalls, we will need to understand something that the Scriptures make clear. Firstly, we don't just hope in Christ's return. Rather, our hope is in the new world that Christ's return offers – the new heaven and new earth that will be established, and the Reign of God that will finally be completely manifest. Secondly, our hope is not just about some future event, but about a new way of seeing and living in the world now. This means that, rather than try to take the prophetic language of the biblical writers literally, we are to grasp the hope that is found in the meaning of Christ's return, and then live from that hope now, in every detail and interaction of our lives. 
          <br/>This week we explore what it means to live in the hope of God's new world in Christ.</p>
        <p><b>Response</b><br/>The call to stay alert can sometime seem like a passive one – as if we wait until God decides to show up. But the truer picture is that God is always breaking into our lives, and we can cooperate with God's work by invoking God's presence and Spirit. Today, stay alert to God's presence by inviting God's Spirit to be revealed to you throughout the day.</p>

        <p class="serif"><b>Reflection</b><br/>The big question that Paul continually seeks to answer is simply this: "How then should we live?" In the light of all that God has done, is doing, and will do in Jesus, what should our response be? At the heart of this response is the realisation that we are united with Christ. Through the sacrament of baptism, we join ourselves with the death of Jesus - the sacrificial act of love through which we find our home in God's Reign. But we have also buried our lives in the life of God and been raised into God's new life - the life of eternity, experienced here and now. It is not that baptism has some magical quality. It's that baptism reveals the presence and grace of God that is already at work in us and in the world, and to which we open ourselves through faith in Christ.
          <br/>But the real miracle of this union with Jesus is that we are no longer at the mercy of our worst selves. Those things that bring death to us and others - our quests for power, possessions and pleasure – have lost their hold on us, and now we live according to the values of God's life, and we seek to bring life to others. This is a constant journey of growth and change, and it is built on the knowledge that Christ's life and power are available to us now, and that we are participating in bringing God's new world into being by living our most loving and just lives in our small corner of the world. In other words, we should live as those who overcome our worst, live as our best selves, and bring life wherever we can. This is Paul's answer to the question. And when we do this, we experience God's coming to us in every moment.
          <br/>How can you live in this way today?</p>
        <p><b>Response</b><br/>Paul is very clear that living this new life in Christ is not something we can do in our own strength. It is only as Christ's life takes hold of us by God's Spirit that we are transformed from our worst selves into our best selves. This means that prayer is a crucial practice in this journey. As we pray - for ourselves and others – we open ourselves to God's life and we experience transformation, both personally and communally. Why not pray like this today?</p>

        <p class="serif"><b>Reflection</b><br/>Hebrews 11 is the great chapter on faith. We often love to read the first verses of the chapter which speak of faith as the assurance of what we hope for and of what is not yet seen. We forget that this is not referring to anything our hearts might desire but is speaking of our Christian hope – the establishment of God's Reign among us. We also love to read the stories of the heroes and heroines of faith who achieved great things and saw great miracles. It is not often, if we're honest, that we read all the way to the end of the chapter and read about some of the other things that happened to people because of their faith – public shame and mockery, whippings and imprisonments, stonings, being cut in two, and murdered with swords. All of this suffering was said to be the result of their faith, too! What makes it worse is that the writer says that they did not receive what was promised, because the promise had to wait for future generations (like us) to receive it.
          <br/>All this resonates with the words of Jesus from Sunday. It is clear that following Jesus does not guarantee a peaceful, successful, and trouble-free life. Rather, what it does guarantee is the Spirit of God and the strength of God to carry us through when tough times hit. Our faith is not seen by the so-called blessings we accumulate. Rather it is seen by our character and attitude in the face of suffering and persecution, and it is seen by our willingness to embrace sacrifice for the sake of others. When we nurture this kind of faith in our hearts, then we become Advent people, for whom, and through whom, God's Reign is always being manifest.
          <br/>How can you nurture this faith in your heart today?</p>
        <p><b>Response</b><br/>What kept these faithful people strong was not their faith in God's "blessings", but their faith in God's goodness and in God's Reign. They were willing to give everything – even their lives – for the sake of bringing salvation and wholeness to the world. Their praises of God's Reign inspired this faithful commitment. Today allow your praises to inspire you in the same way.</p>

        <p class="serif"><b>Reflection</b><br/>Today's Psalm celebrates what happens when we know that God is "for us". As we remember Jesus’ warnings about the turmoil we would experience in the world, it is important to note that even the Psalmist recognised that having God's presence and grace with us does not keep us from tough times. It's not that the Psalmist was not attacked, but that the attack did not destroy God's people. It's not that the waters did not rage and flood, but that the flood did not sweep God's people away. It's not that there were no enemies seeking to trap God's people, but that the people were able to escape, as birds from a cage.
          <br/>It's important that we place these words alongside the ones we read in Hebrews yesterday, though. In that passage, even having God's favour and presence did not save some of the faithful ones from death. We make a mistake if we think of our faith as a fortress which makes us impervious to the suffering of the world. This is not what Jesus offers, and it is not what he calls us to. Rather, we are called to embrace the struggles of our human existence, to stand with those who are persecuted, attacked, entrapped, or who suffer trauma, and bring the life, love and care of God to them. When our faith stops us from seeing God as a divine bodyguard, and leads us to see ourselves as God's hands and feet, God's defenders of the threatened, and providers for the poor, then our faith truly lifts us above the pain and struggle of this world, and becomes something that allows God's Reign to break into our lives, and the lives of those around us. What an amazing Advent hope this is!
          <br/>How can you be an agent of God's Advent hope to others today?</p>
        <p><b>Response</b><br/>Sometimes all people need to carry them through their times of struggle is some kindness. Whether it's a kind word, or an act of kindness that helps them to grieve or to survive, there is tremendous power in kindness - and it costs so little. Today, speak words of kindness and blessing over everyone you meet - and act with kindness if they need it.</p>

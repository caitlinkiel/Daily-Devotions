        <h4>A Brief History and Background</h4>
        <p class="serif">In the mid-1960s, a group of denominations in the United States and Canada came together to form the <a href="http://www.commontexts.org/">Consultation on Common Texts</a> (CCT) as a resource and forum on the renewal of worship in the Christian community. In 1992, they published the Revised Common Lectionary (RCL), derived from the Common Lectionary of 1983 which itself was based on the Ordo Lectionem Missae of 1969 and the Roman Lectionary. Each of these was designed to structure worship services to provide more consistency and a richer variety of Scripture. Additionally, they helped to expose congregations to a greater portion of the Bible and to help them make thematic connections between the Old and New Testaments.
<br/>The Revised Common Lectionary is a three-year cycle of weekly lections (lessons or readings) built around the seasons of the Church calendar. Most lections contain a reading from the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament), a Psalm, a reading from the Epistles, and a Gospel reading.</p>
       <p class="serif"; style="margin-left:40px"><b>Year A:</b> Matthew, the Patriarchs, and the Exodus<br/>
       <b>Year B</b>: Mark and the monarchial narratives<br/>
       <b>Year C</b>: Luke and the Prophets </p>
       <p class="serif">The other readings often, but not always, follow along thematically, with the Gospel of John interspersed through all three years.
</p>
      </div>

      <div class="stack-block">
        <h4>The Liturgical Calendar</h4>
        <p class="serif">The liturgical calendar and Church year follow the life of Christ and are broken into six seasons:</p>
        <p class="serif"; style="margin-left:40px"><b>Advent:</b> The season of Advent begins the first Sunday after Thanksgiving; between November 27 and December 3 and lasts a total of four weeks, which are spent in preparation before the celebration of the Messiah’s birth
<br/>
<br/><b>Christmas:</b> The Christmas season includes Christmas Eve, a midnight Christmas Vigil and Christmas Day, followed by a 12-day celebration dedicated to the nativity of the Christ-child that culminates on Epiphany on January 6.
<br/>
<br/><b>Epiphany:</b> A celebration of the Magi, the baptism of Jesus, and Christ’s role as the Savior of Jews and Gentiles alike, this season continues up to Ash Wednesday (the specific number of weeks will vary depending on where Easter falls). This is the first part of Ordinary Time in many calendars.
<br/>
<br/><b>Lent:</b> Beginning with Ash Wednesday, the season of Lent lasts exactly 40 days, reflecting the 40 days of preparation that Jesus spent int the desert before beginning His ministry. It concludes with the Sunday of Holy Week.
<br/>
<br/><b>Easter:</b> Holy Monday is the official beginning of the Easter season, a joyful celebration of the death, resurrection and ascension of Christ, and Pentecost marks its end seven Sundays later.
<br/>
<br/><b>Ordinary Time:</b> From the Latin ordinalis, meaning ‘numbered’ or ‘ruled’, the second half of Ordinary Time contains all the remaining weeks in the calendar, and focuses on the life and ministry of Jesus.</p>
